# States are represented by 3-tuples of integers in the range 0, ..., k.
#
# Transitions are 2-tuples of states (start_state, end_state), where start_state
# is the start of the transition and end_state is the end of the transition.
#
# Reachable states should be represented by a 3-tuple (state, length, previous)
# where state is the reachable state, length is the length of the path to get
# there, and previous is the previous state. For the 0 length path to the start,
# that would be (start, 0, start).

# transitions is a list of 2-tuples of 3-tuples (x, y, z)
#   where 0 <= x, y, z <= k.
# Note that the start state is reachable through a path of length 0.
